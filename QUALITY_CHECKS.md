## Quick Commands

```bash

npm run quality:check

# Run quick quality checks (fast feedback)
npm run quality:quick

# Individual checks
npm run lint              # ESLint
npm run format:check      # Prettier
npm run check:duplication # jscpd
npm run check:dead-code   # ts-prune
npm test                  # Vitest
npm run build            # Production build
```

## Before Committing

**Recommended workflow:**

```bash
# Quick check while developing
npm run quality:quick

# Full check before committing
npm run quality:check
```

## Auto-fix Common Issues

```bash

## CI Equivalent

The `quality:check` command runs the exact same checks as CI, so if it passes locally, it will pass in CI.

## Tips

- Run `quality:quick` frequently during development for fast feedback
- Run `quality:check` before pushing to ensure CI will pass
- Use `lint:fix` and `format` to auto-fix most issues
- Check `docs/code-quality.md` for detailed documentation
